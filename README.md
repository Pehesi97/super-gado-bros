# Super Gado Bros

In Super Gado Bros, you are Peter.

Peter is half bull, half man. While he has the goals, dreams, and ambitions of a human, he also has the instincts and strength of a bull. However, he stands out for one unique trait: his horns. They're powerful and unmistakable.

Like all bulls, Peter fights for territory. He seeks to maintain his dominance over the other bulls in Gadoland. These bulls come toward him, and Peter must use his impressive set of horns to defeat them, one by one.

If a bull attacks him when heâ€™s caught off guard, or while he's walking peacefully, Peter is banished from existence and, consequently, from Gadoland.

If Peter collides with a bull while running, he initiates a horn fight. This horn fight must be resolved by pressing the button suggested on the screen. If the wrong button is pressed, Peter is killed by the opposing bull.
